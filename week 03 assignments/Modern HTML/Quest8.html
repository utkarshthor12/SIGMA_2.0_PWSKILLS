            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. </p>

            <h3>What is semantic HTML?</h3>
            <p>Semantic HTML, also known as semantic markup, refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning—or semantics—of the content contained within them. <br />
            By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.</p>
