                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used
                to create web pages. It is a language that defines the structure,
                content, and layout of a web page. HTML uses various tags and
                attributes to mark up text, images, videos, and other media types,
                making it possible for web browsers to display them in a visually
                appealing way. HTML also provides links and navigation elements that
                allow users to move from one page to another. HTML is not a
                programming language but rather a markup language that works in
                conjunction with other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to
                create responsive, interactive, and dynamic web pages.

              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used for
              styling web documents written in HTML or XML. It defines how HTML
              elements are to be displayed on screen, in print, or in other media.
              CSS allows web designers to control the layout, typography, colors,
              and other visual aspects of web pages. By separating the presentation
              from the content, CSS enables greater flexibility and consistency in
              web design. CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block,
              with properties and values that define how the selected elements
              should look. CSS is essential for modern web design and is widely used
              across the web development industry.

            <dd>
              JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to add interactivity
              and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows web developers to create
              complex and interactive web applications, such as games, social media
              platforms, and e-commerce sites. JS can manipulate and change the
              content of web pages, respond to user events, and interact with
              server-side applications. JS code can be embedded directly into HTML
              documents or included as separate files, and it can be executed on
              both client-side and server-side environments. As one of the core
              technologies of the web, JS is essential for modern web development
              and is supported by all major web browsers.

              MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database used for storing
              and retrieving data in a flexible and scalable manner. It is designed
              to handle large volumes of structured and unstructured data and
              provides a rich query language for searching and filtering data.
              MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which can be nested and
              hierarchical, making it easy to store complex data structures. It
              supports dynamic schema design, allowing developers to add or modify
              fields in documents without changing the database schema. MongoDB is
              highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and offers features such as
              replication and sharding for distributing data across multiple
              servers. It is widely used in modern web development for building
              scalable and real-time applications.
